There are different command:£GetInstructions            to see the instruction of the app;GetMetadata                to see the correlation between the variables,the type and their mean;GetData                    to see the data in the database;GetData       (POST+body)  to see only the data that satisfy the filter into the body;GetStats                   to see the stats of height/width/dimension of the images;GetStats      (POST+body)  to see the stats of a group of the database that satisfy the filter into the body;GetFieldStats              to see the stats of the field added like param;GetFieldStats (POST+body)  to see the stats about the field added with the tweet that satisfy the filter;£The filtering operators that you can use in the form '{'field':{'operator':value}}':£$in :[val,...]     to see the tweet that contains almost one of the hashtags added;$not:val           to see only the tweet that don't contain noone of the hashtags added;$nin:[val,...]     to see the tweet that don't have almost one of the hashtags;$gt :val           to see the post that have a field with a number bigger than the value added           (>val);$gte:val           to see the post that have a field with a number bigger or equal than the value added   (>=val);$lt :val           to see the post that have a field with a number lower than the value added              (<val);$lte:val           to see the post that have a field with a number lower or equal than the value added    (<=val);$bt :[val1,val2]   to see the post that have a field with a number between the two added            (val1< <val2);£To use more filters you can have the possibility to use macro operator  'filter={'macro-operator':[{'field':{'operator':value}},...]}':£$or    to see all the tweet that satisfy almost one of the condition added;$and   to see the tweets that satisfy all the conditions added;£To see a full desciption of the app, see:£https://github.com/valerio1805/ProgettoProgrammazione2k20
